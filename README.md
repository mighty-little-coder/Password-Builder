# Password Builder

## Description

This password generator is designed to randomly generate a string of characters, provided by the user, to create a secure and randomized password. This is accomplished through various window prompts and confirms. Additionally, there is a copy to clipboard function added so the user is able to easily duplicate the password and store it to the clipboard.

This feature was brand new to me and required some research to accomplish.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This project is designed to fully randomize a password based on basic criteria supplied by the user. The randomization is precisely what makes the password more secure by adding even more obscurity to the string of letters, numbers and special characters.
